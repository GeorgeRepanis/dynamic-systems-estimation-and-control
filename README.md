Final project for *Simulation & Modeling of Dynamical Systems*: real-time parameter estimation and model selection for linear and nonlinear systems, with robustness considerations and projection methods. Includes adaptive estimation of unknown (A,B) on a 2-state LTI system and evaluation under biased/noisy conditions, plus nonlinear identification using polynomial, RBF, and problem-specific bases with RLS and RMSE comparison. 
*Note:* It may contain mistakes—the project was graded at *60%*—but I believe it’s still worth sharing.
